search(array, low, high);

mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
value = array[mid];

loop until low === high;
return false;

```
condition 1 - if value is found, return true
--- mid is the value we are looking for

condition 2 - if value is less than mid, search left by setting high to equal mid - 1
--- mid is -1 because we already checked mid and it is not the value we are looking for

condition 3 - if value is greater than mid, search right by setting low to equal mid + 1
--- mid is +1 because we already checked mid and it is not the value we are looking for

```
